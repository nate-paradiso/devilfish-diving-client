        , hereby affirm that I am a certified scuba diver trained in safe dive practices, or a
        student diver under the control and supervision of a certified scuba instructor. I know that
        skin diving, freediving, and scuba diving have inherent risks, including those risks
        associated with boat travel to and from the dive site (hereinafter “Excursion”), which may
        result in serious injury or death. I understand that scuba diving with compressed air
        involves certain inherent risks, including but not limited to decompression sickness,
        embolism, or other hyperbaric/air expansion injuries that require treatment in a
        recompression chamber. If I am scuba diving with oxygen enriched air (“Enriched Air”) or
        other gas blends including oxygen, I also understand that it involves inherent risks of
        oxygen toxicity and/or improper mixtures of breathing gas. I acknowledge this Excursion
        includes risks of slipping or falling while on board the boat, being cut or struck by a boat
        while in the water, injuries occurring while getting on or off a boat, and other perils of
        the sea. I further understand that the Excursion will be conducted at a site that is remote,
        either by time or distance or both, from a recompression chamber. I still choose to proceed
        with the Excursion in spite of the absence of a recompression chamber in proximity to the
        dive site(s).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I understand and agree that neither
        <span className="font-bold text-lg"> Devilfish Diving LLC</span>; nor the dive
        professional(s) who may be present at the dive site, nor any of their affiliate and
        subsidiary corporations, nor any of their respective employees, officers, agents,
        contractors, and assigns (hereinafter “Released Parties”) may be held liable or responsible
        in any way for any injury, death, or other damages to me, my family, estate, heirs, or
        assigns that may occur during the Excursion as a result of my participation in the Excursion
        or as a result of the negligence of any party, including the Released Parties, whether
        passive or active.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I affirm I am in good mental and physical fitness for the Excursion. I further state that I
        will not participate in the Excursion if I am under the influence of alcohol or any drugs
        that are contraindicated to diving. If I am taking medication, I affirm that I have seen a
        physician and have approval to dive while under the influence of the medication/drugs. I
        understand that diving is a physically strenuous activity and that I will be exerting myself
        during the Excursion and that if I am injured as a result of heart attack, panic,
        hyperventilation, drowning, or any other cause, that I expressly assume the risk of said
        injuries and that I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for the same.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am aware that safe dive practices suggest diving with a buddy unless trained as a
        self-reliant diver. I am aware it is my responsibility to plan my dive allowing for my
        diving experience and limitations, and the prevailing water conditions and environment. I
        will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to safely plan my dive, dive
        my plan, and follow the instructions and dive briefing of the dive professional(s).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If diving from a boat, I will be present at and attentive to the briefing given by the boat
        crew. If there is anything I do not understand, I will notify the boat crew or captain
        immediately. I acknowledge it is my responsibility to plan my dives as no-decompression
        dives and within parameters that allow me to make a safety stop before ascending to the
        surface, arriving on board the vessel with gas remaining in my cylinder as a measure of
        safety. If I become distressed on the surface, I will immediately drop my weights and
        inflate my BCD (orally or with low pressure inflator) to establish buoyancy on the surface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am aware safe dive practices recommend a refresher or guided orientation dive following a
        period of diving inactivity. I understand such a refresher/guided dive is available for an
        additional fee. If I choose not to follow this recommendation, I will not hold the Released
        Parties responsible for my decision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I acknowledge Released Parties may provide an in-water guide (hereinafter “Guide”) during
        the Excursion. The Guide is present to assist in navigation during the dive and identifying
        local flora and fauna. If I choose to dive with the Guide, I acknowledge it is my
        responsibility to stay in proximity to the Guide during the dive. I assume all risks
        associated with my choice whether to dive in proximity to the Guide or to dive independent
        of the Guide. I acknowledge my participation in diving is at my own risk and peril.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I affirm it is my responsibility to inspect all of the equipment I will be using prior to
        leaving the dock for the Excursion and that I should not dive if the equipment is not
        functioning properly. I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to
        inspect the equipment prior to diving or if I choose to dive with equipment that may not be
        functioning properly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I acknowledge Released Parties have made no representation to me, implied or otherwise, that
        they or their crew can or will perform effective rescues or render first aid. In the event I
        show signs of distress or call for aid, I would like assistance and will not hold the
        Released Parties, their crew, dive boats, or passengers responsible for their actions in
        attempting the performance of rescue or first aid.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I hereby state and agree that this Agreement will be effective for all Excursions in which I
        participate for one (1) year from the date on which I sign this Agreement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I further state that I am of lawful age and legally competent to sign this liability
        release, or that I have acquired the written consent of my parent or guardian. I understand
        the terms herein are contractual and not a mere recital, and that I have signed this
        Agreement of my own free act and with the knowledge that I hereby agree to waive my legal
        rights. I further agree that if any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable
        or invalid, that provision shall be severed from this Agreement. The remainder of this
        Agreement will then be construed as though the unenforceable provision had never been
        contained herein. I understand and agree that I am not only giving up my right to sue the
        Released Parties but also any rights my heirs, assigns, or beneficiaries may have to sue the
        Released Parties resulting from my death. I further represent that I have the authority to
        do so and that my heirs, assigns, and beneficiaries will be estopped from claiming otherwise
        because of my representations to the Released Parties.
