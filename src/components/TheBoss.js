            Resting on the sandy bottom lies a rubble pile comprising of two wrecks stacked one atop
            the other. Partially disintegrated cabin cruisers form a small reef. Among the tangled
            wreckage, remnants of the vessels can be discernedâ€”a flattened stern, a pointed bow, and
            even a solitary toilet from the head. This dive site is easily accessible and suitable
            even on days with heavy currents.
