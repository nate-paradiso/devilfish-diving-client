          The C-Dory 22ft cruiser is a classic vessel known for its durability, versatility, and
          reliability. Originally built in Auburn, WA in 1987 it remains a popular choice among
          boaters due to its sturdy construction and seaworthiness.

          This vessel has seen a lot of the Puget Sound, Neah Bay and the San Juan Islands. It is
          the biggest little boat and is perfect for a small dive crew. With an Alaskan bulkhead
          divers can stay out of the wind or rain between dives and have a panoramic view of the
          water.

          Safety is of the most importance. The vessel is equipped with redundancy. Two fuel tanks
          separated by a valve, one main 90hp Suzuki, one 9.9hp Suzuki kicker outboard motor, dual
          GPS units and dual VHF radios. Equipped with the latest Garmin depth sounder, electronic
          charts and radar navigating the waters of the Puget Sound is safe and reliable.
