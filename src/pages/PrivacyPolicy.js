      <p>
        We collect information that you provide directly to us, such as when you fill out forms on

      <h2 className="text-lg">Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information. However,
        no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so

      <p>
        We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary for the purposes outlined
        in this Privacy Policy. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include the
        nature of the data, the purposes for which it is processed, and any legal or regulatory
        requirements.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-lg">Data Subject Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to access, rectify, or delete your personal information. If you would
        like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided at
        the end of this Privacy Policy.
